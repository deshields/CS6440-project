## Does HIPAA allow a health care provider to communicate with a patient’s family, friends, or other persons who are involved in the patient’s care? ##
Yes. In recognition of the integral role that family and friends play in a patient’s health care, the HIPAA Privacy
Rule allows these routine – and often critical – communications between health care providers and these
persons. Where a patient is present and has the capacity to make health care decisions, health care
providers may communicate with a patient’s family members, friends, or other persons the patient has involved
in his or her health care or payment for care, so long as the patient does not object. See 45 CFR
164.510(b). The provider may ask the patient’s permission to share relevant information with family members
or others, may tell the patient he or she plans to discuss the information and give them an opportunity to agree
or object, or may infer from the circumstances, using professional judgment, that the patient does not object. A
common example of the latter would be situations in which a family member or friend is invited by the patient
and present in the treatment room with the patient and the provider when a disclosure is made.
