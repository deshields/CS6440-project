## Intended Behaviours ##
Below are a list of intended behaviours that may seem strange and their reasoning for being there.

Intended because I didn't have a moment to implement Oauth authorization, and felt that it'd be safer to refuse to use cookies to keep a user logged in as we're dealing with medical information. Also makes it simpler to demo.
