### Sign Up ###
From the home page, select the "Sign Up" button and proceed through the form. You should be redirected to the profile.

### Inviting Providers ###
You can invite new providers using the two icon buttons under the right side of the profile. If you haven't generated a code before, there will only be one. The left (or only) button allows you to generate a new consent document for new intended providers. Check off at least one provider and hit the arrow in the bottom-right. The menu will flash then disappear, and a new icon will appear to the right of the first. Click that one to download and view the consenting document.
